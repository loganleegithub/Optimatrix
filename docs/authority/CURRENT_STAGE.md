# Optimatrix Current Stage

**Status:** B3 CANDIDATE-LOCAL DATA READINESS — CLOSED

**Current maturity:** `B3_ATOMIC_PUBLIC_SHADOW`

**Product Authority:** `INVERSE_BTC_SHORT_VOL`

**Implementation:** `BTC_0DTE_TWO_SIDED_PREMIUM_SALE_V1`

**Current task kind:** `NONE`

**Sole authorized closure:** `NONE`

## Current permissions

Stage is the permission ceiling; a future active task may only narrow it.

**Offline checks and simulation:** authorized only in caller-supplied ignored roots

**Public market calls:** `NONE_AUTHORIZED`

**Stable ObservationLedger root:** `NONE_AUTHORIZED`

**Disposable offline ObservationLedger:** authorized only under caller-supplied ignored roots

**Stable CaseJournal root:** `NONE_AUTHORIZED`

**Frozen prior evidence:** `/Users/logan/Library/Application Support/Optimatrix/b3-public-shadow-v1`
is retained without migration or mutation and remains ineligible for the current Policy.

**Continuous runtime:** `NONE`

**Private read-only account permission:** `NONE`

**Orders, capital, and deployment:** `NONE`

**Policy qualification / Edge claim:** `NONE`

## Current implementation truth

- Entry reunderwriting requires later environment, exact frozen structure, economics, allocation,
  and route evidence to pass before a Shadow Position exists, and its complete Decision-to-Entry
  result remains recoverable.
- Policy schema 9 gives new MarketObservations, Decisions, route evidence, allocations, and Cases
  identities distinct from schema-8 and frozen v1 evidence without changing any Policy threshold or
  ranking rule.
- `ShadowRiskAllocation` records nominal contractual payoff, boundary-valued exit-cost stress,
  every inverse-delivery stress, their maximum delivery loss, and one conservative stress reserve.
  The reserve is exactly the maximum of nominal payoff, exit stress, and maximum delivery stress.
- The same reserve and metric own Decision admission, Session aggregation, the frozen allocation
  record, Case validation, restart reconstruction, and terminal release. Missing, malformed,
  identity-incoherent, or retired-metric allocation records fail closed rather than contributing an
  invented zero.
- The adversarial deterministic Candidate has `200 USD` nominal payoff and `402 USD` exit stress.
  With `300 USD` already reserved against the unchanged `600 USD` Session budget, it is rejected;
  the former nominal-only permissive branch is therefore absent.
- Every selected current-Policy Decision freezes one content-addressed route record, and every
  Entry freezes a distinct later record. Both bind the exact frozen `+1/-1/-1/+1` instruments,
  full target amount, causal cut, per-leg component depth, synthetic model, fee projection, and
  economics; Ledger, Journal, recovery, Outcome, and Workbench retain their identities.
- Route status distinguishes `EVALUABLE`, `NOT_EVALUABLE`, and `UNKNOWN` without inventing depth or
  whole-product economics. Only `EVALUABLE/COMPONENT_SYNTHETIC_ESTIMATE` can support a Shadow
  Position.
- B3 route constructors and strict codecs reject `COMBO_BOOK_QUOTE`, `RFQ`, and `ACTUAL_FILL`, plus
  every injected Combo-instrument, RFQ, order, trade, fill, account, executable-liquidity, and
  fill-probability field. A standard Combo fee projection remains only a cost-model fact.
- Every requested-but-unusable option book is retained as typed, content-addressed metadata with
  its instrument, product, expiry, strike, option type, and reason. A request failure is localizable
  only when the validated Deribit clock supplies its causal completion boundary; otherwise the
  bounded snapshot fails.
- Structure search evaluates every usable-book Candidate under the unchanged Policy. Missing books
  that cannot participate in any Policy-legal four-leg geometry do not block the observed Primary;
  if an unresolved Candidate could still change the rank, the Window is `UNKNOWN` with the exact
  missing book identities and cannot allocate risk.
- Source/receive span, freshness, continuity, required metadata, response timing, and instrument
  identity remain global causal DataHealth. The slow-unavailable-book fixture still fails globally
  on its original receive-span and stale boundaries.
- Workbench schema 6 exposes Candidate-local readiness, unavailable books, and unresolved Primary
  rank without inventing a structure.
- The complete repository gate passes: `212` tests and `8` deterministic business scenarios. This
  is offline implementation evidence, not current market, execution, or profitability evidence.
- Live runtime, stable-root writes, market calls, private facts, orders, and capital remain disabled.

**Primary blocker:** `OUTCOME_EXPLANATORY_PATH_THIN` — current terminal economics do not yet retain
the complete Decision-to-Entry change, MFE/MAE, maximum Delta, short-strike distance, IV/RV path,
data gaps, bounded alternatives, and exit counterfactuals required by the audit sequence.

## Maturity ladder

- `A0_AUTHORITY_CORRECTION` — one owner per concept, explicit truth layers, and no cross-layer
  inference.
- `B1_WINDOW_OBSERVATION` — causal all-Window ObservationLedger and measured reachability.
- `B2_STRUCTURE_PRICING` — route-independent whole-four-leg discovery and inverse-unit economics.
- `B3_ATOMIC_PUBLIC_SHADOW` — complete whole-product Shadow Case, monitoring, terminality, and
  explanatory Outcome without fill claims.
- `C1_PRIVATE_READ_ONLY` — authenticated account truth with no order permission.
- `C2_AUTHORIZED_COMBO_EXECUTION` — separately authorized bounded Combo execution.
- `D1_OFFLINE_AI_CHALLENGER` — forward Outcomes support human-governed Challenger evaluation.

**Next closure:** a bounded `B3_OUTCOME_EXPLANATORY_PATH` task must add the declared explanatory
path without changing Policy thresholds, ranking, execution truth, live permissions, or B4 scope.
