# Optimatrix BTC 0DTE

Optimatrix is the local package for the product defined in
[Product Authority](docs/authority/PRODUCT_CONSTITUTION.md).

This README is package guidance, not product Authority. Agents start at `AGENTS.md`; current
permission and maturity are in `docs/authority/CURRENT_STAGE.md`.

## Local setup and checks

```bash
make sync
make check
.venv/bin/python -m optimatrix --help
```

`make check` is offline evidence only. A network command requires exact authorization in the active
task and Stage; CLI help and source own its syntax.
